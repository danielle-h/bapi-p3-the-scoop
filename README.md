# bapi-p3-the-scoop

This is the 3rd project in build Apis from scratch in codeacademy.
In this project, you will build all of the routing and database logic for an article submission web app called The Scoop.

The Scoop allows users to:

Create and log in to custom username handles
Submit, edit, and delete articles containing a link and description
Upvote and downvote articles
Create, edit, and delete comments on articles
Upvote and downvote comments
View all of a user's articles and comments

Our job was to add the routes and database handling fro comments and add persistnet database using yaml (bonus).
